This is a prize-winning website myself and my friend Jordan Ward, created in about 30 hours for Griffith Hackathon 2019. It is not fully functional with database integration or sanitisation, or other important features, but it was our first real attempt at creating a website outside of assignment requirements. In the short time since creating this, I've learned a lot that could be applied to this to greatly improve it and make it actually functional. ie, Laravel framework. 

The idea is essentially to swap your park with someone in order to get a lift to your car / offer to pick someone up from the class(close to it) and drive them to their park and then take their park, which is a method of reducing waiting times and net traffic at uni.
